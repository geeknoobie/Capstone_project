Data Preparation:
1. Image Preprocessing {done}
   - Standardize image sizes across both datasets
   - Apply consistent contrast enhancement
   - Normalize pixel values
   - Set up data augmentation for medical images

2. Data Organization
   - Create a unified data loader that can handle both datasets
   - Structure the labels properly (binary for fractures, multi-label for chest conditions)
   - Split data into training, validation, and test sets
   - Set up batch generation that balances both tasks

Model Architecture:
3. Base Network Design
   - Choose and set up a suitable backbone (like ResNet or DenseNet)
   - Determine how many layers to share before splitting into heads
   - Design appropriate feature extraction layers

4. Specialized Heads
   - Design fracture detection head (binary classification)
   - Design chest condition head (multi-label classification)
   - Set up appropriate activation functions for each head

5. Training Setup
   - Design loss functions for each head
   - Set up metrics for both tasks
   - Create a combined training objective
   - Implement learning rate scheduling
   - Set up model checkpointing

6. Training and Validation
   - Implement training loop handling both tasks
   - Create validation procedures for both heads
   - Set up early stopping based on combined performance
   - Monitor for overfitting on either task

7. Evaluation and Testing
   - Create separate evaluation metrics for each task
   - Implement confusion matrices for both heads
   - Calculate precision, recall, and F1 scores
   - Create visualizations of model predictions

8. Model Refinement
   - Analyze error patterns
   - Fine-tune the balance between tasks
   - Optimize model architecture based on performance
   - Implement any necessary model improvements
